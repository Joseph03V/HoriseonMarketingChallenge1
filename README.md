# Horiseon Marketing Page 
 
 ## Functionality 
 This page is for a marketing agency. The website provides information for customers.
 The aspects in which Horiseon specializes in. 

 ## Improvements 
 I made the code more semantic. Made it easer to follow with semantic elements. I also 
 added comments to add even easier direction for readers. I also fixed some css correspond
 with the new semantic elements. I also added functionality to the header, so that the "Search Engine Optimization" 
 actually works. Before only two out of three elements worked. 

 ## Future Implimentations
 In the future I would like to add maybe transitions to the links, as well as more css code to 
 make the page more visually appealing to the reader. 

 ## Challenges I faced
 The only challenge I faced was when I was trying to fix the first link. It was really just me 
 overthinking it. I failed to see the simple mistake which was just forgetting to add an ID to my class attribute.
